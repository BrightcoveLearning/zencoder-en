<h1>Error: RTMPMaxStreamsXIdReached</h1>
            <p>This topic provides details on the Zencoder API error: <code>RTMPMaxStreamsXIdReached</code></p>
                <article class="bcls-article"><section class="bcls-section"><h2 id="Meaning">Meaning</h2>

<p>This error means that the CDN has rejected a RTMP stream because there are too many streams using the same stream ID. So the maximum number of streams per ID is exceeded.</p>
</section><section class="bcls-section"><h2 id="More_Information">More Information</h2>

<p>This may mean:</p>

<ul><li>The maximum streams per ID configured in the CDN is too low to accept all the requested streams</li>
	<li>Other Zencoder jobs are already streaming to this CDN and stream ID</li>
	<li>The CDN stream ID is being used by another system outside of Zencoder</li>
	<li>The CDN could have 'zombie' streams, where a previous stream was not properly disconnected and is still counting toward the maximum stream limit for this ID</li>
</ul><p>To avoid this issue, you can stop the other jobs that have streams using the this stream ID, or use another stream ID if you have it. For further information you can <a href="http://zencoder.com/contact">contact support</a> with the Job ID and our engineering team will investigate.</p>
