<h1>Error: UnsupportedCodecError</h1>
            <p>This topic provides details on the Zencoder API error: <code>UnsupportedCodecError</code></p>
                <article class="bcls-article"><section class="bcls-section"><h2 id="Meaning">Meaning</h2>

<p>Zencoder supports <a href="https://zencoder.com/en/formats">hundreds of codecs</a>, but there are still a few we don't support:</p>

<ul><li>Apple Intermediate</li>
	<li>HDV 720p60</li>
	<li>Go2Meeting3/4 (G2M3/G2M4)</li>
</ul><p>If you send these files in, they will fail. The reason for this is that our transcoding workers are all Linux, and there is no Linux decoder for these codecs. We are actively working on adding support for these codecs, probably through the addition of non-Linux servers.</p>
