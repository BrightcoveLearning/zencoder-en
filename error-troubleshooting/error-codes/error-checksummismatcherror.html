    <h2>Meaning</h2>

    <p>The MD5 checksum computed for the input file does not match the checksum supplied to the API.</p>

    <p>There are a variety of possible causes for this problem. The most likely are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The file was corrupted in transit.</li>
      <li>The checksum supplied to the API was incorrect.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="Workarounds" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Workarounds</h2>

    <p>Check to make sure that the checksum you supplied to the API matches the checksum of the file on disk.</p>

    <p>If they <em>don't</em> match, please make a new API call with the proper checksum.</p>

    <p>If the checksums <em>do</em> match, the file may have been corrupted during transfer. Please resubmit the job.</p>

    <p>In either case, if the retry fails, please contact us.</p>
