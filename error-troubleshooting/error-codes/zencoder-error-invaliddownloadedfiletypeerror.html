<h1>Error: InvalidDownloadedFileTypeError</h1>
            <p>This topic provides details on the Zencoder API error: <code>InvalidDownloadedFileTypeError</code></p>
                <article class="bcls-article"><section class="bcls-section"><h2 id="Meaning">Meaning</h2>

<p>We tried to download a file at the specified address, but instead of a video or audio file, we got back something else, like a HTML or XML document. This could be something like a File Not Found error page, but these pages usually come back with a 404 response code (or some other error code), and this error only happens when the HTTP response code was 2XX, indicating that the website thought this was a successful request. So it may be a typo, a bad input URL, or a misconfigured error page.</p>
