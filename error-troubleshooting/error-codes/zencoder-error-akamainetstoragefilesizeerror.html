            <p>This topic provides details on the Zencoder API error: <code>AkamaiNetStorageFileSizeError</code></p>
                <article class="bcls-article"><section class="bcls-section"><h2 id="Meaning">Meaning</h2>

<p>We tried to upload the file to the specified Akamai NetStorage location, however Akamai terminated the connection before the upload finished. This is sometimes due to file-size limitations on the Akamai account. For instance, Akamai might reject an 11 GB file upload if the maximum file-size permitted is 10 GB.</p>

<p>Check the file-size limitation on the Akamai NetStorage account to make sure that the size of this output is within the account limits.</p>
