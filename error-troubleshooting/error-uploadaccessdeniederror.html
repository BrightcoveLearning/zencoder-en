<h1>Error: UploadAccessDeniedError</h1>
            <p>This topic provides details on the Zencoder API error: <code>UploadAccessDeniedError</code></p>
                <article class="bcls-article"><section class="bcls-section"><h2 id="Meaning">Meaning</h2>

<p>We tried to upload the file to the specified address, but got a permission error. If this is a S3 URL, you probably need to <a href="/using-zencoder-s3">grant read access to Zencoder</a> for this bucket or file. The easiest way to do this is to use a S3 client, like Amazon's AWS Console.</p>

<p>In technical speak, this means that we got a 403 Access Denied response from the server.</p>

<p>Make sure that permissions on the file at the given URL allow Zencoder access. If the file is on S3 you may need to <a href="/using-zencoder-s3">grant read access to Zencoder</a>.</p>
