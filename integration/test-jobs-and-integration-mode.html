    <p>Test jobs are free on Zencoder. There are some limitations on the outputs created as test jobs.</p>
    <p>Test jobs are particularly useful when you setting up integration, as they allow you to test as many requests as you like without incurring charges.</p>
		<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note that in Integration Mode, all encoded files will be shortened to 5 seconds, and you will not be charged for the job.</aside>
