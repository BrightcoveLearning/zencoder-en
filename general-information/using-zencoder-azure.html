<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Azure URLs must use the azure://account-name:account-key@container/blob format. The following job request shows how to reference Azure locations for inputs and outputs:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "api_key": "93h630j1dsyshjef620qlkavnmzui3",
    "input": "azure://account-name:account-key@container/file-name.avi",
    "outputs": [
    {
        "url": "azure://account-name:account-key@container/output-file-name.mp4",
        "width": "1280",
        "height": "720"
    }
    ]
}</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>account-name</strong> and <strong>account-key</strong> should be CGI escaped. Nothing else should need to be escaped, as with other URLs in Zencoder. They can be found in the Azure management interface. The account-name is the name of the storage account (linked to region, etc). Keys are available from the bottom of the overview screen for the account.</p>

<p>Each Azure account can have multiple containers. The <strong>container</strong> field in the URL must be defined and configured in Azure before it can be used in a Zencoder job.</p>

<p>The <strong>blob</strong> field in the URL represents the name of the file. The blob is the only component of the URL that does not need to be configured in advance in Azure.</p>
