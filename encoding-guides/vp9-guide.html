    <p>VP9 is available to all customers. Like HEVC, VP9 is able to achieve significantly higher compression at a given level of quality than H.264. Browser support includes Chrome, Firefox and Opera. Device support is currently limited to Android though many of the major connected TV manufactures are beginning to add VP9 support as part of the YouTube logo certification program.</p>
